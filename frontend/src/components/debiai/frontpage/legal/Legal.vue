    <p>The following are permitted without express authorization:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Citations which respect the author's right to attribution and integrity by citing their name
        and the source. The citation must be both a short excerpt from the original publication and
        a short insertion into the publication it later appears in. The citation illustrates a
        statement and must not compete with the source publication.
      </li>
      <li>
        Creating a link, provided that it opens a new, separate window of the browser, and that the
        page that the link leads to is not embedded inside other pages of a different site,
        particularly through the use of frames, belonging to the linked site. Using so many
        citations as to constitute a compilation is considered to be a derivative work, and is
        therefore subject to the prior agreement of the author or copyright holder.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In other cases, and in particular:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you want to display the logo of IRT SystemX</li>
      <li>
        If the contents of the site <a :href="url">{{ url }}</a> are to be integrated into the
        appearance of your site, particularly through the use of frames
      </li>
      <li>
        If the pages containing the link to the site <a :href="url">{{ url }}</a> are behind a
        paywall
      </li>
