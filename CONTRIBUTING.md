## How to become a contributor

We expect to see submissions on these topics:

- Bug reports and feature requests
- New widgets
- [New features, improvements, bug fixes or changes to existing features](#new-features-improvements-bug-fixes-or-changes-to-existing-features)

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you
wish to make via issue before making a change.

### Bug reports and feature requests

If you have a bug report or feature request, please [fill an issue](https://github.com/debiai/debiai/issues/new).

### New widgets

Please follow the [widget creation guide](./frontend/doc/new-widgets/Adding-new-widgets.md) to create a new widget.

### New features, improvements, bug fixes or changes to existing features

If you want to contribute, start working through the DebiAI codebase,
navigate to the [Github "issues" tab](https://github.com/debiai/debiai/issues) and start looking through interesting issues. If you are not sure of where to start, then start by trying one of the smaller/easier issues here i.e. [issues with the "good first issue" label](https://github.com/debiai/debiai/labels/good%20first%20issue).

If you decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so we and other people know that you're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue comment thread to coordinate, we will be happy to help.
